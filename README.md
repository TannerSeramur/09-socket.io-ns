### Modules
#### `socket.io`
#### `socket.io-client`
In this lab we wrote a couple of servers that communicate with one another via sockets. In this project we used our app.js file to generate a event call every 3 seconts which told our server.js file to generate a different number and letter and then emit that to our front end react app to display. We used different rooms on this project too so that we could show both positive and negative numbers, and upper and lowercase letters. 

### Setup
#### `.env` requirements
* `PORT` - 3000

#### Running the app
* `npm start` on both server.js and app.js

#### Notes
Pair programmed this with john
